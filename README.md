## create_nano

To ensure a smooth data preparation process, please follow these steps carefully:

***[Download the create_nano.py script:](https://github.com/BHI-Research/nano-datasets/blob/main/create_nano.py)***

Ensure that you have the `create_nano.py` script ready for execution. You can find the script in the provided repository or download it directly from the given link.

### ***[[Download the folders k400, k600, and k700:]](https://github.com/BHI-Research/nano-datasets/tree/main/k400)*** 

Obtain the `k400, k600, and k700 folders`, which contain the necessary datasets. Make sure these folders are correctly named and contain all the required data files.

***Place all files in the same directory:***

Organize your working directory by placing the create_nano.py script and the k400, k600, and k700 folders together in the same directory. This setup is crucial for the script to locate and process the files efficiently.

***Run the create_nano.py script:***

Execute the create_nano.py script `python create_nano.py`. During execution, the script will prompt you with three questions:


`. Directory where you want to save the videos (if you want to use this same directory press enter): "C:\Users\nano-dataset\Nueva-carpeta"
`

`. Name of .csv file: train.csv`

`. Number of videos per class: 1`


Make sure to provide accurate and complete responses to these prompts to ensure successful execution.
